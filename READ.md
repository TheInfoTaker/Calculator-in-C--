# Overview

 This software serves as a basic calculator that performs addition and subtraction operations and maintains a history of calculations.

**Description**
The C++ software I developed is a basic calculator program. It allows users to perform two mathematical operations: addition and subtraction. The program takes user input for operands, performs the selected operation, and displays the result. Additionally, it provides the functionality to save and load calculation history to/from a text file.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of creating this software was to reinforce my knowledge of C++ language syntax and gain practical experience in implementing console-based applications. This project allowed me to practice fundamental concepts such as input/output, functions, control structures, and file handling.

# Development Environment

During the development of this software, I used the following tools and environment:

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE): - Visual Studio Code
- Programming Language: C++
- Libraries: Standard C++ Library

Youtube: I found a video that explained how C++ words and a tutorial about how to make a calculator which I used for inspiration.

Stack Overflow: Stack Overflow was a valuable resource for troubleshooting issues and finding solutions to programming problems encountered during development.

# Future Work
In the future, I plan to enhance this software by implementing additional mathematical operations, error handling, and a more user-friendly interface. Some specific improvements and additions include:

- Adding support for multiplication and division operations.
- Implementing error handling to address invalid user inputs.
- Providing the ability to clear the calculation history.
- Optimizing and refactoring the code for better maintainability.

This project has been a valuable learning experience, and I look forward to further improving and expanding the functionality of this C++ calculator program.
